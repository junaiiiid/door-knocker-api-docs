        - User receives email with a reset link pointing to: `https://door-knocker-web-app.vercel.app/reset-password`
        - The link contains an access token in the URL parameters
        - Frontend extracts the token and calls /resetPassword endpoint

        The reset email contains a secure link with an access token that can be used

      summary: Search referrals with pagination
      description: |
        Searches referrals based on query and/or filters with pagination support.

        **Business Rules:**
        - Either `query` or `filters` must be provided (at least one is mandatory)
        - Query searches by home owner name or phone number (case-insensitive, partial match)
        - Filters can include: job_type, status, and/or value
        - If both query and filters are provided, all criteria are combined (AND logic)
        - Supports pagination with page and limit parameters (default: page=1, limit=10, max: 100)

        **Query:**
        - Searches in home_owner_info.name and home_owner_info.phone
        - Partial string matching, case-insensitive

        **Filters:**
        - job_type: Must be a JSON object with id and/or name
        - status: Must be a JSON object with id and/or name
        - value: Must be a number (exact match)
        - At least one filter field must be provided if using filters

        **Pagination:**
        - page: Page number (default: 1, min: 1)
        - limit: Results per page (default: 10, min: 1, max: 100)

        **Returns:** Paginated array of matching referrals ordered by created_at (newest first)

        **Step 3: Add Offer Details**
        Adds offer headline, description, dates, CTA, and disclaimer.

        **Step 4: Add Business Details**
        Adds business name, phone, website, QR URL, and before/after images.

        Deletes a campaign by ID. This action is irreversible.

        **Cascade Behavior:**
        - Automatically deletes all campaign_history entries (ON DELETE CASCADE)

        - Logs deletion action before removing the campaign

        - Campaign Management
      summary: Generate live preview of campaign postcard
      description: |
        Generates a visual preview of a postcard using PostGrid's API without actually sending it.

        **Use Cases:**
        - Real-time preview during Step 3 (offer details entry)
        - Preview after Step 4 (business details entry)
        - Final preview before sending campaign

        **How it Works:**
        - Takes campaign data (or preview overrides) and merges with template
        - Creates a PostGrid postcard with sendDate set to 2099 (never sends)
        - Returns preview image URLs (front, back, thumbnails, PDF)

        **Preview Data Override:**
        - Pass `preview_data` to override campaign data for real-time preview
        - Useful for showing live updates as user types in Step 3

      summary: Send campaign postcards to recipients
      description: |
        Creates and sends physical postcards via PostGrid API using campaign data.

        **Prerequisites:**
        - Campaign must have completed steps 1-4:
          - Step 1: Referral linked
          - Step 2: Template selected
          - Step 3: Offer details added
          - Step 4: Business details added

        **Process:**
        - Fetches campaign data (template_id, offer_data, business_data)
        - For each recipient, creates a PostGrid postcard with merged data
        - Updates campaign metrics (postcards_sent)
        - Logs action to campaign_history

        **Batch Sending:**
        - Accepts array of recipients
        - Returns success/failure status for each recipient
        - Continues processing even if some recipients fail
