        Sends a password reset email to the user using Supabase Auth.
        Always returns success to prevent email enumeration attacks.

        **Reset Flow:**
        - User receives email with a reset link pointing to: `https://door-knocker-web-app.vercel.app/reset-password`
        - The link contains an access token in the URL parameters
        - Frontend extracts the token and calls /resetPassword endpoint

        The reset email contains a secure link with an access token that can be used
        with the /resetPassword endpoint.

  /getAddressesFromZone:
    post:
      tags:
        - Address Discovery
      summary: Get addresses from a geographic zone
      description: |
        Discovers addresses within a specified radius or count using OpenStreetMap.

        **Use Case:**
        - Find addresses for door-knocking campaigns
        - Discover residential or commercial buildings in a target area
        - Get addresses without Google Maps API dependency

        **Features:**
        - Supports two modes: radius-based or count-based search
        - Accepts address as lat,lng coordinates or full text address
        - Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim for geocoding
        - Uses Overpass API for building discovery
        - Filters by building type (ALL, RESIDENTIAL, OTHER)
        - Returns full address details with coordinates
        - Saves zone to location_zones table and returns zone_id
        - **Campaign Linking**: When campaign_id is provided, automatically unlinks ALL existing zones from that campaign before creating the new zone (ensures only the newest search zone is linked to the campaign)

        **Building Type Classifications:**
        - **RESIDENTIAL**: apartments, barracks, bungalow, cabin, detached, annexe, dormitory, farm, ger, hotel, house, houseboat, residential, semidetached_house, static_caravan, stilt_house, terrace, tree_house, trullo
        - **OTHER**: commercial, industrial, office, retail, warehouse, religious buildings (church, mosque, temple, etc.), civic/amenity (hospital, school, museum, etc.), agricultural (barn, greenhouse, stable, etc.), sports (stadium, sports_hall, etc.), storage (shed, hangar, etc.), parking/garages, and more
        - **ALL**: Returns both residential and other building types

        **Address Geocoding:**
        - Uses reverse geocoding to get complete addresses (street, city, state, ZIP)
        - Supports optional Google Maps API key in x-google-api-key header for best results
        - Falls back to OpenStreetMap Nominatim if no Google key provided
        - Google Maps provides faster, more accurate addresses

        **Authentication:**
        - Requires JWT authentication via Authorization header (use "Authorize" button at top)
        - campaign_id is mandatory

      summary: Verify addresses in a zone using PostGrid
      description: |
        Verifies addresses in a saved zone using PostGrid address verification API.
        Updates the zone in the database with verification results.

        **Use Case:**
        - Validate addresses before sending postcards
        - Filter out undeliverable addresses
        - Get standardized address format

        **Features:**
        - Fetches zone by zone_id from location_zones table
        - Verifies all addresses in the zone using PostGrid API
        - Updates zone in database with verification status for each address
        - Returns all addresses with verified: true/false status (or only verified if showOnlyVerified=true)
        - Saves verified status to database in the zone
        - Only status='verified' is considered verified (not 'corrected')
        - Batch processing up to 10,000 addresses
        - Optional filtering to return only verified addresses in response

        **Address Parsing:**
        - Parses address formats: "Street, City, State ZIP" or "Street, City State ZIP"
        - Sends parsed components to PostGrid in format: {address: {line1, city, provinceOrState, postalOrZip, country}}
        - Returns verified address from PostGrid response

        **Authentication:** Requires JWT authentication (use "Authorize" button at top) and PostGrid API key in header
      operationId: verifyAddresses
      security:
        - SupabaseAuth: []

      summary: Prepare campaign for launch with address verification (ADMIN/MARKETER only)
      description: |
        Verifies all addresses in a campaign's zone and calculates launch costs.

        **Features:**
        - ADMIN and MARKETER only
        - Campaign must have zone_id set
        - Verifies all addresses using PostGrid API
        - Calculates final cost based on verified addresses
        - Stores/updates launch data in launch_ready_campaign_data table (upserts based on campaign_id)
        - Updates campaign with launch_ready_id reference
        - Organization-scoped
        - Prevents duplicates: If called multiple times for the same campaign, it updates the existing entry

        **Business Rules:**
        - Only ADMIN and MARKETER users can launch campaigns
        - Campaign must be linked to a location zone (zone_id not null)
        - Maximum 10,000 addresses per zone
        - Only verified addresses (status='verified') are counted
        - Final cost = validated_addresses × amount_per_postcard
        - Default amount_per_postcard is $3.00

      summary: Get all addresses from organization zones
      description: |
        Retrieves all addresses from all location zones in the user's organization with optional filtering.

        **Business Rules:**
        - Returns addresses from all zones in the organization
        - **NEVER returns "Unverified" addresses** - they are always excluded
        - Optional filtering to show only exclusion addresses (Duplicate and Opt-out)
        - Automatic deduplication based on lat/lng coordinates
        - Includes zone metadata for each address
        - **Zone Filtering:**
          - Default (no `showAll` parameter): Returns addresses only from zones with `campaign_id` (linked to campaigns)
          - `showAll=true`: Returns addresses from all zones including those without `campaign_id`

        **Request Methods:**
        - GET: Returns Valid, Duplicate, and Opt-out addresses (excludes Unverified)
        - POST: Supports filtering with request body

        **Filtering Logic:**
        - showOnlyExclusions = false (default): Returns Valid, Duplicate, and Opt-out addresses (excludes Unverified)
        - showOnlyExclusions = true: Returns only Duplicate and Opt-out addresses (excludes Valid and Unverified)

        - Supports matching addresses across multiple zones simultaneously

        **Matching Logic:**
        - Uses coordinate matching with tolerance (±0.000001 degrees)
        - Approximately 0.1 meter precision for address matching
        - Updates all matching addresses found in any zone

        **Use Cases:**
        - User opts out from receiving marketing materials
        - Compliance with do-not-contact requests
        - Global exclusion management
        - Address blacklisting across campaigns

      summary: Search referrals with pagination
      description: |
        Searches referrals based on query and/or filters with pagination support.

        **Business Rules:**
        - Either `query` or `filters` must be provided (at least one is mandatory)
        - Query searches by home owner name or phone number (case-insensitive, partial match)
        - Filters can include: job_type, status, and/or value
        - If both query and filters are provided, all criteria are combined (AND logic)
        - Supports pagination with page and limit parameters (default: page=1, limit=10, max: 100)

        **Query:**
        - Searches in home_owner_info.name and home_owner_info.phone
        - Partial string matching, case-insensitive

        **Filters:**
        - job_type: Must be a JSON object with id and/or name
        - status: Must be a JSON object with id and/or name
        - value: Must be a number (exact match)
        - At least one filter field must be provided if using filters

        **Pagination:**
        - page: Page number (default: 1, min: 1)
        - limit: Results per page (default: 10, min: 1, max: 100)

        **Returns:** Paginated array of matching referrals ordered by created_at (newest first), each with image_url (first image from gallery, empty string if no images)

      description: |
        Multi-step campaign creation process. Each step updates the campaign.

        **Step 1: Create Campaign with Optional Referral**
        Creates a draft campaign with a campaign name. Referral link is optional.

        **Step 2: Select Templates**
        Selects templates for front and back of the postcard. Accepts both database UUIDs and PostGrid template IDs. Supports organization templates and universal templates (is_universal=true). Updates templates' campaigns_used array with campaign name.

        **Step 3: Add Offer Details**
        Adds offer headline, description, dates, CTA, and disclaimer.

        **Step 4: Add Business Details**
        Adds business name, phone, website, QR URL, and up to 6 optional images (image_1_id through image_6_id).
        Image IDs must exist in gallery (uploaded via /uploadImage). URLs are fetched automatically from gallery.
        Gallery lookup priority: referral's gallery first, then organization's gallery.
        Automatically creates a shortened tracking link via Linkly API for the QR URL.
        Requires Linkly credentials in request headers (x-linkly-api-key, x-linkly-workspace-id).

        **Step 5: Link Zone to Campaign**
        Links a location zone (from getAddressesFromZone) to the campaign by saving zone_id.

        **Step 6: Campaign Consents/Disclaimers**
        Validates and stores campaign consents. All consents must be provided and set to true.

        **Business Rules:**
        - Organization-based (user must be in organization)
        - Step 1 creates new campaign, steps 2-6 require campaign_id
        - Each step advances current_step counter
        - Campaign starts in Draft status
        - Step 6 validates all consents are true, stores them in campaign

        **Returns:** Updated campaign object

        Deletes a campaign by ID. This action is irreversible.

        **Cascade Behavior:**
        - Automatically deletes all campaign_history entries (ON DELETE CASCADE)
        - Removes campaign_id from campaigns_used array in all templates belonging to the organization
        - Sets campaign_id to NULL in associated referrals (ON DELETE SET NULL)
        - Logs deletion action before removing the campaign

      summary: Get organization-level analytics with daily caching
      description: |
        Returns organization-level analytics with intelligent daily caching.

        **Features:**
        - ✅ Daily caching - First request computes, subsequent requests fetch from cache
        - ✅ Automatic refresh each day
        - ✅ Organization-scoped data
        - ✅ Multiple analytics types supported

        **Supported Analytics Types:**
        - **REFERRALS**: Total referrals, campaign-ready referrals, campaign-published referrals, and average referral value
        - **TEMPLATES**: Template usage analytics by campaign status (active, draft, inactive)
        - **CAMPAIGNS**: Active campaigns, postcards sent, total spent, total leads generated, and average scan rate
        - **DASHBOARD**: Combined dashboard view with referrals, campaigns, estimated conversion rate, and average scan rate

        **Caching Behavior:**
        - First request of the day: Computes analytics from database, saves to cache, returns `cached: false`
        - Subsequent requests (same day): Fetches from cache, returns `cached: true` (~50-100ms)
        - Next day: Cache refreshes automatically with new date

        **Authentication:** Required (JWT token)

        **Authorization:** Organization-based (ADMIN, MARKETER, TECHNICIAN)

        **Business Rules:**
        - Only ADMIN users can manage payment methods
        - Creates Stripe customer on first payment method addition
        - First payment method is automatically set as default
        - Subsequent payment methods require explicit default setting
        - Generates notification: "Payment Method {last4} added to your organization"

        **Frontend Integration:**
        1. Use Stripe.js to collect card details
        2. Create payment method token: `stripe.createPaymentMethod()`
        3. Send `payment_method_id` to this endpoint

        **Authentication:** Required (JWT token)
